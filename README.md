###  Natural Language Processing (NLP) 

[Project Jokebot](https://github.com/chongjunn-tech/project-jokebot)
- Project jokebot is a simple web-based application (using streamlit app) where it allows aspiring comedians to understand the 'joke rating' of their jokes.
- Created an interactive front-end interface powered with streamlit to allow users to understand the humor rating of their jokes
- Deployed an API (FASTAPI) by using Docker Containerization. The API leveraged a pre-trained SOTA BERT model for humor detection.

### Classification Problem
<a href=https://github.com/chongjunn-tech/MLP>Machine Learning Pipeline (MLP)</a>
- This repo showcase a simple Machine Learning Pipeline (MLP) that I have built which process dataset and feed into various machine learning algorithm(s) namely Logistic Regression, K-Nearest neighbors,Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classifer, Adaboost and XGBoost
- The pipeline is easily configurable to enable easy experimentation of different algorithms and parameters through config.yml file
- Simple streamlit App was used to allow user interactivity
- Best Model will be saved in a pickle file for export purpose
